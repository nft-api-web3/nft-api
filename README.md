Working with NFTs is very difficult - the ERC standards are poorly followed and metadata is scattered across the web.
Therefore it's very important that you use a reliable NFT API that can normalize all NFT data from different blockchains.

## Moralis NFT API
Moralis NFT API has through time to be the most reliable and trusted NFT API for our projects and dapps. A great feature of the Moralis NFT API is the fact that it normalizes metadata, ownership data, price data and so much more across different chains and NFT standards.
